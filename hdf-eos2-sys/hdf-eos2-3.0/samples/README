This directory provides sample programs for the user to run to check if the 
HDF-EOS library installed correctly.  Below is a description of what routines 
are available and the order in which the routines should be run.

Swath Demonstration Programs
----------------------------
SetupSwath:   1) Creates swath file, "SwathFile.hdf" and a single swath within
                 it, "Swath1".

              2) Defines dimensions and the geolocation relation between 
	         them.

FORTRAN: setupswath


DefineFields:    Defines a number of fields within the swath, "Swath1".

FORTRAN: definefields


WriteFields:     Writes data to the "Longitude", "Latitude", and "Spectra" 
                 fields.

FORTRAN: writefields


ReadFields:      Reads data from the "Longitude" field.

FORTRAN: readfields


InquireSwath:    Retrieves and print information on the swath dimensions,
                 geolocation relations and swath fields.

FORTRAN: inquireswath


AppendField:     Demonstrates use of unlimited dimension for appendable
                 fields.

FORTRAN: appendfield


SubsetSwath:     Demonstrates subsetting on the "Spectra" field.

FORTRAN: subsetswath




Grid Demonstration Programs
---------------------------
SetupGrid:        Creates grid file, "GridFile.hdf" containing two grid 
	          structures.

FORTRAN: subsetgrid


DefineGDflds:     Defines fields within the two grid structures.

FORTRAN: definegdflds


WriteGDflds:      Write to fields within the two grid structures.

FORTRAN: writegdflds


ReadGDflds:       Reads from fields within the two grid structures.

FORTRAN: readgdflds


InquireGrid:      Demonstrates the use of various inquiry routines in the
                  grid API.

FORTRAN: inquiregrid


SubsetGrid:       Demonstrates subsetting on the "Temperature" field
                  in the "PolarGrid" grid.

FORTRAN: subsetgrid


Swath Demonstration Programs
----------------------------
SetupPoint:   1) Creates point file, "PointFile.hdf" and defines three point
                 structures, "Simple Point", "Fixed Buoy Point", and 
                 "Float Buoy Point".
 
 
FORTRAN: setuppoint
 
DefineLevels:    Defines levels within the pointfile.
 
FORTRAN: definelevels
 

WriteLevels:     Writes data to levels within the pointfile.
 
FORTRAN: writelevels
 
 
ReadLevels:      Reads data from levels within pointfile.
 
FORTRAN: readlevels
 
 
UpdateLevels:    Updates levels within pointfile.
 
FORTRAN: updatelevels
 
 
SubsetPoint:     Demonstrates subsetting with the point interface.
 
FORTRAN: subsetpoint
 




Restrictions
------------
1) The "HDFE_ANYPOINT" option for swath subsetting has not yet been
   implemented.  In additin swath subseting does not work with the
   "Colatitude" field yet.
